## Analysis Overview
### 1. Business Needs
<strong>What products are the bestsellers and when do the customers buy the most?</strong>
### 2. Observe Data
First I took a look at what I'm dealing with. Is the data uniform? Anything missing or out of place? 
What I found was this list of retail data included returns which aren't needed for this analysis and could muck up the analysis.
For this project, I decided to remove UK data from the equation and focused on all data outside the UK.
### 3. Results
The question is a bit ambiguous depending on your definition on bestseller. Is it by total sales, profit margin, quantity, or something else?
For this proejct, I decided, total sales can keep everything on the same page best.
