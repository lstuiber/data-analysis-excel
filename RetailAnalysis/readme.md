## Analysis Overview
### 1. Business Needs
<strong>What products are the bestsellers and when do the customers buy the most?</strong>
### 2. Observe Data
First I took a look at what I'm dealing with. Is the data uniform? Anything missing or out of place? 
What I found was this list of retail data included returns which aren't needed for this analysis and could muck up the analysis.
For this project, I decided to remove UK data from the equation and focused on all data outside the UK.
### 3. Results
The question is a bit ambiguous depending on your definition on bestseller. Is it by total sales, profit margin, quantity, or something else?
For this proejct, I decided, total sales can keep everything on the same page best. The amount of items by quantity sold per day doesn't mean much from a sales standpoint.
What I found was sales are mostly made at 10am and 12pm, the results are really close for the top spot. Thursday and Tuesday are the best days for sales.

### 4. Next Steps
Based on these results, if we wanted to increase sales based on when users are most likely to buy we should increase ad campaigns on Tuesday and Thursdays at 10am and 12pm.
If we want to pick up the slack on days where we aren't getting any sales, we need to focus on discounts on Sundays around 10am to drive more sales.
Sundays by far have the least amount of sales compared to any other day.
